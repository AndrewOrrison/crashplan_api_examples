SUMMARY:
Takes a comma-delimited CSV file of user names and adds those users to a LDAP Org.

PRE-REQS:
* Python 2.7
* Requests Module
** http://www.python-requests.org/
* PROe Server Host and Port
* PROe Server Admin and Password
* CSV file name
* LDAP ORG ID. You can get this by navigating to the org and getting the org id value from the url. For examples: http://localhost:4280/console/app.html#v=orgs:overview&t=0mbunsjn5sbz91tlzg5clpd7qg&s=orgDetail&so[orgId]=3 would be an Org ID of 3.

STEPS:
1. Create CSV file with comma-delmited list of LDAP users to add to the PROe Server. Save it in the same location as the addLDAPUsers.py script.
2. Update addLDAPUsers.py and add your environment values for cp_host, cp_port, etc.
3. Execute the script and check the addLDAPUsers.log file for your results.

RESULTS:
LDAP Users will be added to the specified CrashPlan Organization.
